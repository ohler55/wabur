# WABuR Tutorial

[WABuR](https://github.com/ohler55/wabur) is a Web Application Builder using
Ruby. Releases and additional information can be found at
[http://www.wab.systems](http://www.wab.systems). The WAB approach to building
web application is to follow a Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern that
separates each element of the MVC cleanly enough to allow a well defined
API. This approach allows flexibility in how each component is
implemented. WABuR expects a JavaScript or variation such as ECMAScript for
the View, Ruby for the Controller, and a choice for the Model depending on a
selection of WAB Runners.

The goals of the WAD design are modularity and simplicity with the intent of
providing an easy to use and maintain system that is also high
performance. This tutorial walks through build a simple application, a blog,
using WABuR. The tutorial is broken into multiple lessons that introduce
additional features in each lesson.

## [Lesson 1 - Quick Start](lesson-1/README.md)

The tutorial starts with a simple object design and continues with a
description of the WABuR development environment. Once the basics have been
covered a blog is implemented.

## [Lesson 2 - UI Options](lesson-2/README.md)

The view and displays are refined with dimensions and field types other than
strictly text. Controller logging is also added.

## [Lesson 3 - Aggregate Objects](lesson-3/README.md)

A new object type, a Comment, is added along with updated displays for the
inclusion of Comments in a blog Entry.
